# to run the server use following command

npm run dev

- There are seperate folders for routes, middleware, controllers, and essentials files in utils folder.

* I used mongoDB Atlas for storing users data.

# Note
If you encounter any errors while connecting to the database, it could be due to an IP address issue. In such cases, please contact me immediately. Although I have made the necessary changes to allow connections from any IP address, MongoDB Atlas might still cause errors due to security restrictions.
